# Tasks: Blog-Tech-Kit Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/000-blog-tech-kit-foundation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), constitution.md (complete)

**Tests**: Not requested - this is infrastructure/tooling development. Validation via manual multi-kit installation testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are organized by user story (US1-US6) to enable independent implementation and testing of each capability.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Path Conventions

- **CLI Package**: `src/blog_cli/` (Python package)
- **Shared Working Directory**: `.blogkit/` (blog-tech-kit specific directory)
- **Templates**: `.blogkit/templates/` (blog-specific templates)
- **Scripts**: `.blogkit/scripts/bash/` (blog utilities)
- **Agent Context**: `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/rules/` (kit-specific files, do not edit .claude/ folder)
- **Reference Docs**: `refs/` (blog-specific examples and guides)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and verification of existing structure

**Note**: Blog-tech-kit is a fork of spec-kit. Most infrastructure already exists. Setup focuses on verification and preparation.

- [x] T001 Verify existing project structure matches plan.md specifications
- [x] T002 Verify Python 3.11+ environment and `uv` package manager installed
- [x] T003 [P] Verify Git repository initialized and on feature branch `000-blog-tech-kit-foundation`
- [x] T004 [P] Verify `.blogkit/` directory structure exists with memory/, scripts/, templates/ subdirectories
- [x] T005 [P] Verify existing reference documentation in `refs/` directory (5 core files + 5_more/)
- [x] T006 Verify pyproject.toml configured with package name `blog-cli` and command `blog`

**Checkpoint**: Environment validated - blog-tech-kit implementation can begin

---

- [x] T008 Verify namespace strategy documented in constitution.md (CLI separation, slash command namespacing, dedicated .blogkit/ directory)
- [x] T009 [P] Create placeholder blog-specific templates in `.blogkit/templates/` (spec-template.md, plan-template.md, tasks-template.md - will be adapted in Phase 3)
- [x] T010 [P] Create placeholder slash command templates in `.blogkit/templates/commands/` (blogkit.*.md files - will be adapted in Phase 4)
- [x] T011 Verify reference documentation structure complete (`refs/0_overview.md`, `refs/1_principles_for_constitution.md`, `refs/2_define_for_specify.md`, `refs/3_project_mangement_for_plan.md`, `refs/4_pm_tasking_for_tasks.md`, `refs/6_claude_code.md`, `refs/5_more/`)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately (verification of existing structure)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (CLI Package): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (Project Init): Depends on US1 completion (requires functional CLI)
  - US3 (Specify): Depends on US2 completion (requires project initialization)
  - US4 (Plan): Depends on US3 completion (requires specification)
  - US5 (Tasks): Depends on US4 completion (requires plan)
  - US6 (Implement): Depends on US5 completion (requires tasks)
  - US7-9 (Additional Commands): Can run in parallel after US2 completion
- **Reference Docs (Phase 10)**: Can run in parallel with US3-9 (independent work)
- **Template Adaptation (Phase 11)**: Depends on US3, US4, US5 (integrates with specify, plan, tasks commands)
- **Multi-Kit Validation (Phase 12)**: Depends on US1, US2, US3, US4 (requires core workflow functional)
- **Polish (Phase 13)**: Depends on all user stories and validation complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
US1 (CLI Package)
    ↓
US2 (Project Init)
    ↓
US3 (Specify) ←→ US7-9 (Additional Commands - parallel)
    ↓
US4 (Plan)
    ↓
US5 (Tasks)
    ↓
US6 (Implement)

Reference Docs (US10) - parallel with US3-9
Template Adaptation (US11) - after US3, US4, US5
Multi-Kit Validation (US12) - after US1, US2, US3, US4
```

### Within Each User Story

- CLI commands before project initialization
- Project initialization before content workflow commands
- Specify before plan before tasks before implement
- Templates before slash commands that use them
- Validation after implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All verification tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Constitution verification and template placeholder creation can run in parallel
- **Phase 3-9**: Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (e.g., T012-T014 in US1)
- **Phase 10 (Reference Docs)**: All reference doc verification tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 11 (Templates)**: Template finalization tasks can run in parallel (T096-T107)
- **Phase 13 (Polish)**: Documentation tasks (T118-T125) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (CLI Package)

```bash
# Launch CLI package verification tasks together:
Task: "Verify CLI package name `blog-cli` in pyproject.toml"
Task: "Verify CLI command `blog` mapped to `blog_cli:main` in pyproject.toml"
Task: "Verify package dependencies include typer, rich, httpx, ..."
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verification)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (CLI Package functional)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Project initialization functional)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test `blog init` creates complete project
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test CLI independently → `blog --help` works (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test project init → `blog init` works
4. Add User Story 3 → Test specify → `/blogkit.specify` works
5. Add User Story 4 → Test plan → `/blogkit.plan` works
6. Add User Story 5 → Test tasks → `/blogkit.tasks` works
7. Add User Story 6 → Test implement → `/blogkit.implement` works
8. Add User Stories 7-9 → Additional commands functional
9. Complete Reference Docs + Template Adaptation → Complete workflow
10. Complete Multi-Kit Validation → Coexistence confirmed
11. Each phase adds capability without breaking previous phases

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Stories 1-2 (CLI + Project Init)
   - Developer B: User Stories 3-4 (Specify + Plan)
   - Developer C: User Stories 5-6 (Tasks + Implement)
   - Developer D: Reference Docs + Template Adaptation
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Final validation together (Multi-Kit Validation + Polish)

- Phase 4 (US2 - Project Init): 10 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Specify): 11 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Plan): 12 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Tasks): 11 tasks
- Phase 8 (US6 - Implement): 9 tasks
- Phase 9 (Additional Commands): 12 tasks
- Phase 10 (Reference Docs): 10 tasks
- Phase 11 (Template Adaptation): 12 tasks
- Phase 12 (Multi-Kit Validation): 10 tasks
- Phase 13 (Polish): 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Both `specify` and `blog` commands work independently
- US2: `blog init` creates complete blog project structure
- US3: `/blogkit.specify` generates blog spec without technology details
- US4: `/blogkit.plan` generates editorial workflow with tech stack
- US5: `/blogkit.tasks` generates sprint-organized task list
- US6: `/blogkit.implement` executes tasks with quality gates

**Suggested MVP**: Complete Phases 1-4 (User Stories 1-2) for functional CLI and project initialization (20 tasks, ~2-3 days)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Multi-kit coexistence is P0 priority - test early and often
- Blog-tech-kit reuses spec-kit infrastructure - most work is adaptation, not creation
- Namespace strategy (CLI separation, slash command namespacing, shared `.specify/`) is critical for coexistence
