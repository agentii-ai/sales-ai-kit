# Step 7: blog-kit Optimization Command 

blog-tech-kit is a good varient of spec-kit, using the same infrastructure @.specify/memory/constitution.md . I want add a new command
  called "optimize" to the project blog-kit , to go future than spec-kit. many complex jobs requires iterative optimization of workflows and
  prompting. the "optimize" or "./blogkit.optimize". read @refs/7_optimization.md about background information of state-of-art agent
  evaluation-suggestion-improvement stages materials. You must all use the same tech stacks / infrastructure of this current blog-kit. add a
  plan.md of adding "optimize command" and version 0.0.4 for blog-kit. the meaning of "optimization" have "evaluation""suggestion"and
  "improvement", also the optimization can have optional "validation" and "iteration". read @refs/7_optimization.md and more references in
  @refs/5_more/ your plan.md should focusing on how to design the blogkit.optimize command to be able to iteratively optimize the results of
  blog-kit. continue to optimize all templates in @.blog/ which is real code will be packaged and released. the input output of the older version
  examples are provided in @examples/ folder. the opimize command will be more about providing a mechanism to evaluta of the blog-kit package,
  rather than optimize a single result
