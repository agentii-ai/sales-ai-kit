# Step 6.1: Use windsurf to build constitution.md

```prompt

/constitution this sales-ai-kit project is a fork of the github.com spec-kit project. read @README_spec-kit.md to get a global view of the original spec-kit and its spec-driven development workflow.

spec-driven development is a strong methodology for complex work with llm-based agents, and the same pattern can be applied to many domains (project management, product design, marketing, business writing, etc.). sales-ai-kit is a featured variant of spec-kit focused on sales and marketing for ai saas products (to B and prosumers).

i will also use this project as a worked example of how to create your own spec-kit variants (for example, pm-kit, pd-kit, marketing-kit, biz-writing-kit). i will develop comprehensive documents in @refs/ to show, step by step, how to use prompts and search tools to build up-to-date references and adapt the original spec-kit templates.

in the constitution for this project, a few things are especially important:
1. i want to reuse the overall spec-kit design, including installation model, cli commands, and how it integrates with claude code, cursor, and other coding agents.
2. users may install multiple *-kit variants on the same machine, so the base `specify` command name can conflict across packages. you must design a clean naming and namespace strategy so spec-kit, blog-kit, pd-kit, and other kits can coexist without collisions.
3. related to (2), slash commands like `saleskit.plan` and `saleskit.implement` are how agents such as claude code / windsurf invoke workflows. you must ensure there is no conflict between commands like `saleskit.plan` and `speckit.plan`, and that they can reliably trigger different agents or workflows.

think carefully and globally about the architecture, naming, and multi-kit coexistence first, then draft a clear, opinionated constitution for sales-ai-kit that respects these constraints and follows the principles in @memory/constitution.md.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT modify the .windsurf/ folder - it's a working copy from spec-kit for the current Windsurf agent to use.
IMPORTANT: The word "specify" shows up in two situations. One situation is as the command name like in "speckit.specify" or "./specify". In this situation, when change to "saleskit.specify" , or "./specify", you should keep as it is for consistency. In the second situation, "specify" refers to the package name, like in folder name for "./specify/memory/constituation.md". Since multiple spec-kit like kits may work together in the same project, their package names should be distinct to avoid conflicts. Change "./specify/memory/constituation.md" to "./saleskit/memory/constituation.md" 
```


# Step 6.2: Use windsurf to build spec.md



```prompt
/specify is running… this sales-ai-kit project is a fork of the github.com spec-kit project. read @README_spec-kit.md to get a global view of the original spec-kit project and its spec-driven development workflow.

spec-driven development is a strong methodology for complex work with llm-based agents, and the same pattern can be applied to many domains (project management, product design, marketing, business writing, etc.). sales-ai-kit is a featured variant of spec-kit focused on ai driven sales and marketing growth for ai saas products.

read @memory/constitution.md and generate the spec.md for this project. you MUST also read @refs/0_overview.md and @refs/1_principles_for_constitution.md and follow its structure and intent.

there are a few important constraints:
1. re-use the overall spec-kit design, including the cli model and how it integrates with claude code, cursor, and other coding agents.
2. assume users may install multiple *-kit variants on the same machine, so the base `specify` command name can conflict across packages. design a clean naming and namespace strategy so spec-kit, blog-tech-kit, sales-ai-kit, pd-kit, and other variants can coexist.
3. related to (2), slash commands like `saleskit.plan` and `saleskit.implement` are how agents invoke workflows. ensure there is no conflict between commands such as `specify.plan` and `saleskit.plan`, and that each reliably triggers the correct workflow.

think carefully and globally about architecture, naming, and multi-kit coexistence first, then draft a clear, opinionated spec.md for sales-ai-kit that is consistent with @memory/constitution.md and suitable as a reference for future *-kit variants.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT modify the .windsurf/ folder - it's a working copy from spec-kit for the current Windsurf agent to use.
IMPORTANT: The word "specify" shows up in two situations. One situation is as the command name like in "speckit.specify" or "./specify".

# Step 6.3: Use Claude Code to build plan.md

/plan this blog-tech-kit project is a fork of the github.com spec-kit project. read @README_spec-kit.md to get a global view of the original spec-kit project and its spec-driven development workflow.

for this task, read @memory/constitution.md and @specs/000-blog-tech-kit-foundation/spec.md. you MUST also read @refs/3_project_mangement_for_plan.md and follow its structure and intent when generating plan.md.

2. assume users may install multiple *-kit variants on the same machine, so the base `specify` command name can conflict across packages. design a clean naming and namespace strategy so spec-kit, blog-kit, pd-kit, and other variants can coexist.
3. related to (2), slash commands like `blogkit.plan` and `blogkit.implement` are how agents invoke workflows. ensure there is no conflict between commands such as `blogkit.plan` and `blogkit.plan`, and that each reliably triggers the correct workflow.

think carefully and globally about architecture, naming, and multi-kit coexistence first. then generate a clear, opinionated plan.md for blog-kit that:
- respects the principles in @memory/constitution.md,
- aligns with the spec in @specs/000-blog-tech-kit-foundation/spec.md, and
- can guide edits to the spec-kit templates in @templates/ and @templates/commands/ to swap `blogkit` → `blogkit` **without** changing the underlying infrastructure.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT modify the .claude/ folder - it's a working copy from spec-kit for the current Claude Code agent to use.
