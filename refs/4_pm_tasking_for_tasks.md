# Step 4: Tasking methodology

Step 4 corresponds to the **tasks.md / `/blogkit.tasks`** phase in Spec Kit, but focused on **blog driven growth for an AI/LLM SaaS product**, not on code implementation.

Where `plan.md` (Step 3) defines *strategy and plan* (objectives, wedge, channels, growth loops, experiments), this step turns that plan into an **executable task list**:

- Clear phases and milestones.  
- Concrete tasks and subtasks.  
- Owners and collaborators.  
- Checkpoints, reviews, and tests (PDCA cycles).  
- Enough structure that a small team can run it like a project.

This is the blog/growth equivalent of a `tasks.md` file for a feature.

## 5. Perplexity research prompt

Use the prompt below in Perplexity (or similar tools) to gather **best-practice tasking and execution patterns** for blog driven growth an AI/LLM SaaS product from blog plan to day-to-day tasks and sprints.

```prompt
you are an expert writing tech blog and growth operator with deep experience in ai/llm saas and agent products (2023–2025), and a background in pragmatic project management.

context:

- step 0–3 in my blog-tech-kit have already produced: an overview of blog for ai saas, principles and patterns, a blog-focused spec (personas, problems, hero workflows, constraints, success metrics), and a non-technical blog plan.md (objectives, strategy, launch/activation, growth loops, metrics, risks).
- now i want to create a **tasks.md** focused on execution and tasking for blog and growth, not on engineering implementation (no stacks/architecture).

please extensively research **recent (2023–2025)** playbooks and examples on how successful ai/llm saas products and high-performing silicon valley teams:

- break their blog and growth plans into **phases, tasks, and sprints**
- use **product-led growth, growth hacking, and virality** in a structured, project-managed way
- define **owners, milestones, checkpoints, and PDCA loops** for blog experiments
- manage tasks across product, design, growth, content, and community for an early-stage ai saas or agent product

focus on concrete practices and case studies from tools such as cursor, claude code, devin, manus, lovable.dev, runway, pika, heygen, photoroom, harvey, writer.ai, canva, figma, notion, and similar products.

for each relevant source or pattern you find, extract key questions and answers about:

- a proposed structure for a blog-focused **tasks.md** (phases, task groups, ownership, checkpoints, exit criteria)
- examples of concrete tasks for ai saas blog work (user research, launch campaigns, growth loop experiments, community building, metrics reviews)
- guidance on using **PDCA (plan–do–check–act)** and sprint cadences to iterate on blog experiments
- suggestions on how to incorporate social channels (twitter/x, reddit, product hunt, linkedin, youtube, tiktok, discord) into the task list in a disciplined way

present the answer as a markdown document that i can adapt directly into `step 4: tasking methodology` and a `tasks.md` file in my blog-tech-kit.


```

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive tasking methodology document. Let me provide you with a summary:

## Blog & Growth Tasking Methodology for AI/LLM SaaS
## Phases, Sprint Cycles, Owners, Checkpoints, and PDCA Loops (2024–2025)

I've created a battle-tested **tasking_methodology.md** document that translates blog strategy into concrete execution phases, sprints, tasks, owners, and PDCA loops. 

### **Document Structure:**

#### **Part 1: Execution Framework** 

**Four-Phase Model:**
1. **Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-4)** — Strategy lock, infrastructure setup, team alignment
2. **Phase 2: LAUNCH (Weeks 5-8)** — Publish first posts, activate distribution, begin community
3. **Phase 3: AMPLIFICATION (Weeks 9-16)** — Scale production, activate growth loops, test experiments
4. **Phase 4: OPTIMIZATION (Weeks 17-24+)** — PDCA cycles, scale winners, optimize systems

***

#### **Part 2: Phase 1 - FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-4)** 

**Two Sprints with Concrete Task Groups:**

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Strategy & Setup**
- Task Group 1: Content Strategy Finalization (define pillars, map personas, create post ideas, document hero workflows)
- Task Group 2: Measurement Setup (GA4, dashboard, UTM structure, CRM integration, PDCA template)
- Task Group 3: Team Onboarding & Alignment (sync meetings, RACI matrix, style guide, publishing workflow)

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Infrastructure & Alignment**
- Task Group 4: Blog Platform & SEO Setup (domain, CMS, analytics, email signup, social sharing)
- Task Group 5: Distribution Channels Setup (audit audiences, identify communities, create templates, setup scheduling)
- Task Group 6: First Content Sprint Prep (outline first 3 posts, assign to writer, setup editorial calendar)

**Phase 1 Checkpoint:** Go/No-Go decision with 6 verification items

***

#### **Part 3: Phase 2 - LAUNCH (Weeks 5-8)** 

**Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): First Posts & Initial Distribution**
- Task Group 7: Content Production Sprint 1 (research, draft, review, edit, create assets for Post 1; draft Post 2 in parallel)
- Task Group 8: Launch Day Execution (publish, share on channels, engage in communities, monitor engagement)
- Task Group 9: Community Engagement Foundation (daily Reddit engagement, weekly Discord, Twitter threads, brand monitoring)

**Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Scale & Iterate**
- Task Group 10: Publish Posts 2-3 & Distribution Experiments (email subject line test, social timing test, new communities)
- Task Group 11: Measurement & First PDCA Cycle (weekly metrics review, performance analysis, retrospective, adjust strategy)

**Phase 2 Checkpoint:** Verify 6-7 items (posts published, distribution active, signups tracked, early winners identified)

***

#### **Part 4: Phase 3 - AMPLIFICATION (Weeks 9-16)** 

**Sprint 5-6 (Weeks 9-10): Batched Content Production**
- Task Group 12: Content Batching Sprint (monthly planning, batch research 4 posts, batch draft, batch review/edit, batch asset creation)
- Task Group 13: Distribution Scaling (identify 10 communities, join 5 new, create variations, schedule 2 weeks ahead)

**Sprint 7-8 (Weeks 11-14): Growth Loop Experiments**
- Task Group 14: Email Nurture Loop (define segments, create sequences, automate, measure conversion)
- Task Group 15: Social Amplification Loop (identify champions, reach out, track organic shares)
- Task Group 16: Community Feed Loop (showcase section, community spotlights, measure engagement)

**Sprint 9 (Week 15): PDCA Deep Dive**
- Task Group 17: Full PDCA Retrospective (analyze experiments, calculate CAC, identify winners, team retrospective, adjust strategy)

**Phase 3 Checkpoint:** Verify 5-6 items (posts published, growth loops tested, CAC established, community engagement active)

***

#### **Part 5: Phase 4 - OPTIMIZATION (Weeks 17-24+)** 

**Ongoing Sprint Structure (Monthly Sprints):**
- Task Group 18: Content Production (continue batching 4 posts per month)
- Task Group 19: Growth Loop Optimization (A/B tests, new communities, timing optimization, new channels)
- Task Group 20: Community Expansion (identify new communities, spotlights, community events)

**Weekly Rituals:**
- Monday (30 min): Plan & assign tasks
- Friday (30 min): Check metrics and learn

**Monthly Ritual:**
- End-of-month retrospective (2 hours): Performance review, content analysis, community health, experiments review, strategy adjustment

**Quarterly Ritual:**
- Full strategy & planning (4 hours): Trend analysis, content effectiveness, community impact, process retrospective, Q2 strategy

***

#### **Part 6: Ownership Matrix (RACI)** 

Clear accountability for:
- Strategy, outlines, review, publishing
- Drafting, design, email nurture
- Social scheduling, community engagement, measurement

Each task has ONE accountable owner (A) who makes final calls.

***

#### **Part 7: Exit Criteria & Checkpoints** 

Template structure for all task groups:
- Completion requirements (checklist)
- Measurement (primary + secondary metrics)
- Go/No-Go decision criteria
- Escalation paths

***

#### **Part 8: PDCA Loop Implementation** 

**Weekly PDCA (5 days):**
- Monday: PLAN (tasks, dependencies, success criteria)
- Tue-Thu: DO (execute, daily standup)
- Friday: CHECK (metrics review) + ACT (adjust next sprint)

**Monthly PDCA (Full Retrospective):**
- Plan: What were we trying to accomplish?
- Do: What did we execute?
- Check: Did we hit targets? What worked/didn't?
- Act: Double down on winners, kill losers, adjust strategy

**Quarterly PDCA (Strategic Review):**
- Plan: What was Q1 goal?
- Do: What did we execute?
- Check: Hit OKRs? Top 3 wins? Top 3 failures?
- Act: Q2 priorities (double down, kill, test new)

***

#### **Part 9: Distribution Channel Task Framework** 

Specific task structures for:
- **Twitter:** Post sharing, thread creation, engagement, tracking, experimentation
- **Reddit:** Community joining, daily engagement, organic posting, mentions monitoring, analytics
- **Email:** Segmentation, sequences, A/B testing, weekly sends, tracking
- **Discord:** Daily engagement, weekly announcements, monthly events, leaderboard management, metrics
- **Product Hunt:** Quarterly launch planning, audience building, launch day execution, tracking

***

#### **Part 10: Sample Tasks.md Template** 

Ready-to-use markdown template showing:
- Phase breakdown
- Sprint assignments
- Task groups with status
- Weekly status tracking
- Monthly retrospectives
- Quarterly strategy

***

#### **Part 11: Common Execution Mistakes** 

Top 5 to avoid:
1. **No Clear Owners:** Every task has ONE accountable owner
2. **No Checkpoints:** Break into sub-tasks with daily/weekly checkpoints
3. **No Measurement:** Every task has measurable exit criteria
4. **Skipped PDCA:** Weekly, monthly, quarterly cycles built in
5. **Too Many Experiments:** Run 1-2 focused experiments per sprint

***

### **Key Execution Principles:**

1. **Phases over Calendar**
   - Foundation → Launch → Amplification → Optimization
   - Not "4 posts/week forever"

2. **Sprints with Clear Exits**
   - 2-week sprints with checkpoint-based progress
   - No ambiguous "in progress" states

3. **Owners with Authority**
   - Every task has one person making calls
   - RACI matrix clarifies collaboration

4. **Measurement Built-In**
   - Every phase has verification metrics
   - Weekly/monthly/quarterly PDCA loops
   - Experiments measured, not guessed

5. **Distribution as a System**
   - Not "just share on Twitter"
   - Specific task groups per channel
   - Community-specific strategies



This document transforms your strategy documents (overview.md, principles.md, spec_refinement.md, strategy_analysis.md, operations_guide.md) into day-to-day execution reality.

Use it to:
- Create your actual tasks.md with specific owners and dates
- Establish weekly/monthly/quarterly rituals
- Run PDCA cycles systematically
- Build distribution as integrated system (not afterthought)
- Scale from 1-person to 5-person teams
