# Step 3: AI driven Sales Operations & Growth Planning

This step defines **how to operate a sales engine for growth** and **how to create compelling content for AI SaaS products**. It covers the operational planning, team workflows, content calendars, and growth mechanisms that turn a sales funnel into a sustainable growth engine.

Based on **Step 0–2**, you already have:
- Principles of effective sales messaging (`step 1`)
- A high-level blog spec with audience, pillars, and metrics (`step 2`)

Now you create a **blog operations plan** that defines *how* to execute consistently and drive measurable growth.

# Planning & Project Management for an AI SaaS Growth Engine

## Perspective: Chief Growth Officer (CGO), AI/LLM SaaS, 2024–2025

This document is a practical operating plan for a **Chief Growth Officer** running an AI/LLM SaaS company. It covers:

- How to **operate a sales engine for growth**
- How to **build a content and campaign engine** that feeds that sales motion
- How to align **RevOps, Marketing, Sales, and CS** around one growth model

The goal is to turn a static funnel into a **sustainable, compounding growth engine**.

---

## 1. Growth Engine Architecture

### 1.1 Growth Model & Targets

Before designing workflows or calendars, lock a simple **growth model**:

- **North Star:** e.g. ARR, qualified pipeline, or number of “activated AI workspaces”
- **12-month goals:** revenue, pipeline, and retention targets
- **Motion mix:** PLG, SLG, or hybrid (for most AI SaaS, hybrid is optimal)

Example (Series A AI SaaS):

- Target: **$1M → $3M ARR in 12 months**
- Pipeline coverage goal: **3×–4× opportunity coverage** on target bookings
- Funnel benchmark targets (rolling 90 days):
  - Visitor → Lead: 1–2%
  - Lead → MQL: 20–30%
  - MQL → SQL: 25–35%
  - SQL → Opp: 50–60%
  - Opp → Closed-won: 25–35%

### 1.2 Org & Ownership (CGO View)

As CGO, your job is to **orchestrate growth across functions**, not just “own marketing”[64][67][70]. For a 10–60 person AI SaaS org, a high-leverage structure is:

- **CGO** (you)
  - **RevOps** (Revenue Operations)
    - Owns data, systems, process, forecasting, territories, attribution[65][68][71]
  - **Growth Marketing**
    - Demand gen, content, SEO/AI-SEO, lifecycle & marketing automation[66][77][83]
  - **Sales**
    - SDR/BDR team, AEs, sales enablement[54][60][69]
  - **Customer Success / Account Management**
    - Onboarding, QBRs, expansion, churn prevention[76][79][82]

RevOps should be centralized (MarOps + SalesOps + CSOps) with clear owners for:

- **Data & Insights** – dashboards, KPIs, cohort analysis[65][71]
- **Process Design** – SLAs, playbooks, routing rules[65][66]
- **Tech & Systems** – CRM, MAP, enrichment, intent signals[65][71]
- **Enablement** – playbooks, training, content for GTM teams[65][71]

---

## 2. Operating a Sales Engine for Growth

### 2.1 Funnel Design & SLAs

Your **sales engine** is only as strong as the agreements that connect marketing, SDRs, AEs, and CS.

Define **service-level agreements (SLAs)** for:

1. **Lead response time**
   - Inbound demo/form: outreach within **5 minutes** (phone + email + LinkedIn)[66]
   - High-intent content downloads (e.g. pricing page, benchmark report): 2 hours[66]
2. **MQL → SQL decision window**
   - SDR must disposition each MQL within **24 hours** in CRM (qualified, not-fit, nurture)[66]
3. **SQL → Opp creation**
   - Any qualified meeting (BANT or PQA in an AI context) is converted to Opp within 24 hours
4. **Recycling rules**
   - “No-show” or “not now” leads go into **automated nurture sequences** within 1 business day[75][78]

Codify these SLAs in RevOps playbooks and enforce them via CRM automation and dashboards.

### 2.2 Sales Team Structure (Up to ~$5M ARR)

For early/mid-stage AI SaaS (ARR $1–5M), a lean but complete sales pod might look like[55][58][61][65][71]:

- **Head of Sales / VP Sales** (reports to CGO)
- **2–3 AEs** (mid-market + enterprise)
- **2 SDRs/BDRs** (outbound + inbound follow-up)
- **1 Sales Engineer or AI Solutions Architect** (for complex demos)
- **Shared RevOps & Enablement** (from central RevOps team)

Key responsibilities:

- SDRs: lead qualification, outbound, appointment setting
- AEs: discovery, demos, proposals, negotiation
- SE: deep technical demos, POCs, security reviews
- RevOps: territory/ICP management, process optimization[65]

### 2.3 Weekly Operating Rhythm

Operate sales like a **factory with feedback loops**:

1. **Daily standup (15 min)**
   - Pipeline changes (new SQLs, new Opps)
   - Stuck deals & blockers
   - AI tools status (sequence performance, lead scores)[54][63]

2. **Weekly revenue sync (60 min)** – CGO + Sales + Marketing + RevOps
   - Review: pipeline creation vs targets, win rate, stage conversion, velocity[68]
   - Channel-wise performance: inbound, outbound, partner, product-led
   - Experiments: subject lines, outbound sequences, landing pages

3. **Bi-weekly deal review (60 min)**
   - Top 10 live deals
   - MEDDIC or similar framework
   - AI-derived insights (Gong-style conversation intelligence, risk flags)[57][63]

4. **Monthly forecast & capacity planning**
   - Update revenue model and targets
   - Adjust quotas, territories, and SDR:AE ratios[68][71]

### 2.4 AI-Driven Sales Workflows

Embed AI at every stage of the sales engine[54][57][60][63][69]:

1. **Lead generation & enrichment**
   - Use AI BDRs (Artisan Ava-type) to:
     - Identify ICP accounts and contacts
     - Enrich with firmographic & technographic data[69]

2. **Lead scoring & routing**
   - Behavior-based scoring (site activity, content consumption, trials)
   - Intent signals (third-party intent tools, search patterns, AI answer engine mentions)[60][66]
   - Route based on score & segment: SDR vs PLG nurture vs self-serve

3. **Outbound & follow-ups**
   - AI-personalized emails, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and cadences[54][69]
   - Cadence templates for:
     - Net-new outbound sequences
     - Lead reactivation sequences
     - No-show remediation

4. **Sales enablement**
   - AI-assisted call coaching (e.g., Gong-style), objection handling snippets, live battlecards[57][63]
   - Auto-generated call summaries and next steps into CRM[54][63]

5. **Forecasting & performance analytics**
   - Predictive pipeline risk (deal health, stage stalling, missing stakeholders)[57][63]
   - Forecast models using historical conversion and seasonal patterns[54][63]

### 2.5 QBRs & Expansion Engine

Retention and expansion are major growth levers in SaaS[76][79][82]. Run **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)** for all mid-market & enterprise accounts:

Every QBR should cover:

1. **Business objectives recap**
   - Repeat back customer’s original goals and any new ones
2. **Usage & value review**
   - How they’re actually using the AI product (features, teams)
   - Outcomes achieved (time saved, revenue added, risk reduced)[79][82]
3. **Gaps & friction**
   - Where adoption lags; where AI isn’t being leveraged
4. **Roadmap & expansion opportunities**
   - New features relevant to their goals
   - Additional teams / geos / use cases
5. **Joint plan for next 90 days**
   - Clear action items on both sides, owner per action[76][79][82]

Treat QBRs as **growth moments**, not just relationship check-ins.

---

## 3. Content Engine: Strategy & Calendars

The **content engine** is the fuel for demand gen, PLG, and sales enablement. For AI SaaS, it must serve **both humans and AI answer engines** (AEO/AI-SEO)[56][59][62][74][77][80][83].

### 3.1 Content Strategy Foundations

Anchor content to **business goals**, not just “publishing cadence”[56][59][62]:

- Annual/quarterly company goals (ARR, new logo targets, product launches)
- Segment goals (enterprise vs mid-market vs SMB)
- Motion goals (PLG signups vs SLG opportunities vs expansion)

Define 3–5 **content themes** that directly support those goals, e.g.:

- “AI compliance & risk for enterprises”
- “How to operate agentic sales teams”
- “AI/LLM SEO and answer engine optimization (AEO)”
- “Implementation playbooks for AI agents in revenue ops”[60][77][83]

Each theme should map to **personas** and **funnel stages**[59][77]:

- CTO / VP Eng
- VP Sales / RevOps
- Head of Marketing / Growth
- Buyer journey: Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Post-purchase

### 3.2 One Idea, Many Formats

Use the **"one idea, many formats"** model[56][59][62]:

1. Start with a **pillar asset**:
   - E.g., "The 2025 AI SaaS Sales Engine Playbook"
2. Spin it into:
   - 2–4 blog posts (SEO + AEO optimized)[74][80][83]
   - 1–2 LinkedIn post series for founders & CGO
   - 1 webinar / live session
   - 1 email sequence for nurture
   - Short-form video snippets
   - Internal sales enablement decks / battlecards

This keeps messaging coherent across all channels and maximizes ROI per idea.

### 3.3 Content Calendar Structure (Quarterly)

Design a **Quarterly Content Calendar** that connects ideas → people → goals[56][59][62]:

Columns to include:

- Topic / Working title
- Theme (e.g., AI Sales Ops, Agent-Led Growth)
- Primary persona
- Funnel stage (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU)
- Format (blog, webinar, case study, email, video, etc.)
- Channel (site, LinkedIn, YouTube, partners)
- Owner (writer/SME)
- Status (Brief → Draft → Review → Approved → Published)
- Target publish date
- Primary CTA (demo, trial, download, webinar signup)

Quarterly planning steps[56][59][62]:

1. Define **quarterly campaigns** aligned with product releases and revenue goals.
2. For each campaign, schedule:
   - 1–2 pillar assets
   - 4–8 supporting blog posts
   - 2–4 customer stories/case studies
   - 2–3 live events (webinars, AMAs)
   - Always-on social/email distribution
3. Assign owners and deadlines; automate reminders via PM tools (ClickUp/Asana/Jira)[59][81].

### 3.4 AI-SEO & AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

In 2025, **language models and AI answer engines** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) are major discovery surfaces[60][77][83]. Optimize content for:

1. **Search intent & jobs-to-be-done**
   - Deep competitor comparisons ("[tool] alternative" case studies)[74]
   - "How to" guides with step-by-step evidence

2. **First-party data & experience**
   - Benchmarks, mini case studies, screenshots, product demos, original research[80][83]

3. **Technical ingestibility**
   - Clean HTML, minimal JS for core content
   - Strong internal links, Q&A blocks, and structured data[83]

4. **Freshness**
   - Quarterly updates to high-traffic content with the latest stats, features, and screenshots; update `dateModified` schema[83].

### 3.5 Content Types by Funnel Stage

Use a **funnel-aware content matrix**[59][62][66][77]:

- **TOFU (Awareness)**
  - Thought leadership on AI trends
  - Problem framing ("Why PLG alone fails for AI products")
  - Podcast appearances, guest posts, research summaries

- **MOFU (Consideration)**
  - Solution guides ("How to structure an AI-driven sales engine")
  - Deep comparison posts ("[You] vs. [Legacy Tool]")
  - ROI calculators, interactive tools, live demos[66][74]

- **BOFU (Decision)**
  - Case studies with hard numbers
  - 2-page solution briefs for procurement
  - Implementation playbooks for technical teams

- **Post-purchase / Expansion**
  - Advanced usage guides
  - Customer-only webinars / office hours
  - Success stories highlighting cross-team use[76][79][82]

---

## 4. Automation & Lifecycle Ops

### 4.1 Core Marketing Automation Workflows

At minimum, configure these workflows in your MAP (HubSpot, Braze, Customer.io, etc.)[75][78][81]:

1. **Welcome / Onboarding Series**
   - Trigger: signup or trial start
   - Steps: Welcome → "How to get value in 5 mins" → social proof → feature nudges → upsell CTA[75][78]

2. **Lead Nurture (Non-converted trials / MQLs)**
   - 6–10 email sequence over 30–45 days
   - Mix of educational content, case studies, product tips, and soft CTAs[75][78]

3. **Abandoned evaluation / no-show**
   - Trigger: booked demo but no-show; or trial created but never activated
   - 3–5 touch sequence: "restart" offer, short explainer video, one-click reschedule[75][78]

4. **Churn prevention & reactivation**
   - Trigger: usage drop (logins, events) or payment failure
   - Re-engagement emails, in-app prompts, and CSM alerts[75][78][82]

5. **Webinar / event flows**
   - Registration → reminders → attendance-based follow-ups (attended vs no-show) → hand-off to SDR if high intent[75][78]

### 4.2 Sales & CS Automation

Embed automation into sales & CS motions[54][63][75][81]:

- Auto-log calls, emails, and meetings to CRM
- Auto-create follow-up tasks based on triggers
- Auto-notify account owners on high-intent signals (e.g., pricing page visits by existing customer)
- Use AI for **send-time optimization** and **subject-line testing**[63][75][81]

---

## 5. Growth Mechanisms & Feedback Loops

### 5.1 Demand Gen Engine

Use an **allbound** strategy (inbound + outbound + partner + PLG)[66][69][72]:

1. **Alignment**
   - Shared KPIs: SQLs, pipeline, LTV/CAC, pipeline velocity[66][68]
   - Clear SLA between Marketing and Sales (see 2.1)

2. **Audience & Tiering**
   - Tier 1: high-fit, high-intent accounts; 70% of paid spend here
   - Tier 2: mid-fit, emerging accounts; nurture with content and lower-velocity outbound[66]

3. **Channel Roles**
   - LinkedIn/Meta: demand creation; thought leadership[66]
   - Google Search/AI-AEO: demand capture (bottom-funnel terms)[66][74][83]
   - Outbound SDR + AI BDR: 1:1 activation for ICP accounts[69]
   - Partners: co-selling, co-marketing; warm introductions

4. **Attribution & Optimization**
   - Use multi-touch attribution (first-touch + W-shape + data-driven) to allocate budget[66]
   - Weekly performance review; adjust spend and creative when KPIs drift.

### 5.2 Operating Metrics & Dashboards

RevOps should maintain **live dashboards** covering[65][68][71]:

- Pipeline by segment, stage, and owner
- Conversion rates between funnel stages
- Channel performance (CAC, SQLs, pipeline per channel)
- Content performance (traffic, assisted pipeline, signups)[74][80]
- Lifecycle health (activation, time-to-value, retention)[75][82]

CGO should run **monthly growth reviews** using these dashboards:

- What’s working? (channels, content, segments)
- What’s broken? (SLAs, drop-off points, messaging)
- What experiments run next?

---

## 6. 90-Day Implementation Plan (CGO Checklist)

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation

- Finalize growth model: targets for ARR, pipeline, activation
- Map existing funnel and current metrics
- Define RevOps ownership and hire/assign key roles if missing[65][71]
- Implement or clean core tooling: CRM, MAP, analytics, call recording, AI BDR tool[63][69]
- Draft SLAs for lead handling and lifecycle

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Sales & Content Ops

- Stand up weekly sales & growth rituals (standups, pipeline reviews, forecast)
- Launch baseline AI-powered outbound cadences (per ICP segment)[54][69]
- Design Q2 content calendar: pillars, supporting assets, events[56][59][62]
- Launch core marketing automation workflows (welcome, nurture, reactivation)[75][78]

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Optimization & Scale

- Roll out QBR program for top 20–50 accounts[79][82]
- Introduce multi-touch attribution and pipeline velocity tracking[66][68]
- Run 2–3 content + offer experiments (e.g., interactive calculators, ROI tools)[66][74]
- Adjust hiring plan for SDRs/AEs/CSMs based on funnel constraints[55][58][61]

---

## 7. Operating Principles for the CGO

As CGO of an AI SaaS company, anchor on these principles[54][60][64][67][70]:

1. **One truth, one dashboard.** No separate versions of reality for marketing, sales, and CS.
2. **Speed over perfection.** Iterate weekly on messaging, targeting, and content; ship, measure, refine.
3. **Outcome-first narrative.** Every campaign, deck, and asset must tie directly to customer outcomes.
4. **Full-funnel thinking.** Acquisition, activation, retention, and expansion are equal parts of the growth engine.
5. **AI as infrastructure, not feature.** Use AI deeply in your own GTM (scoring, sequencing, content), not just in your product.
6. **Rituals > heroics.** Growth comes from boring, repeatable operating rhythms, not one-off hacks.

If you implement this planning and operating model with discipline, your sales funnel stops being a static diagram and becomes a **living system**—a sales and content engine that compounds into sustainable growth.
